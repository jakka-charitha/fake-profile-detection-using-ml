1. Abstract

Paragraph 1: Project Overview
Social media platforms have become a central part of modern communication, allowing millions of users to interact, share content, and build networks. However, these platforms are increasingly targeted by fake profiles and malicious accounts, which can spread misinformation, scams, and spam, undermining the integrity of online communities. The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated system capable of detecting fake social media profiles in real time using advanced Graph Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging the relational structure of user networks and behavioral attributes, the proposed system identifies suspicious accounts more accurately than traditional rule-based or standalone machine learning methods.

Paragraph 2: Problem Addressed and Motivation
Fake accounts often mimic genuine users, making them difficult to detect with conventional techniques based solely on profile metadata. These accounts can manipulate social influence, affect public opinion, and facilitate fraudulent activities. The project addresses this challenge by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly the GraphSAGE algorithm, which can learn node representations by aggregating features from neighboring nodes in the social network graph. This graph-based approach allows the system to capture complex relational patterns and detect subtle anomalies in account behavior.

Paragraph 3: Methodology and Technologies Used
The project utilizes PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric to implement GraphSAGE, enabling efficient inductive learning on social network graphs. The system preprocesses user profile features, scales them for model training, and constructs edges based on similarity thresholds to capture potential connections between users. Supervised training is performed with labeled datasets of real and fake accounts, allowing the model to predict unseen nodes’ authenticity effectively. Visualization techniques such as t-SNE embeddings and subgraph plotting are also incorporated to interpret model behavior and provide insights into the detected fake accounts.

Paragraph 4: Importance and Impact
The developed system significantly enhances social media security by providing automated, scalable, and accurate detection of fake accounts. Its real-time prediction capabilities allow platform administrators to act swiftly against malicious users, protecting genuine users and maintaining trust. Additionally, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph ML in addressing complex social network problems, opening avenues for further research in fraud detection, network analysis, and user behavior modeling. Overall, this work contributes both practically and academically to the field of social media security and intelligent anomaly detection.



2. Introduction

Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have transformed the way people communicate, share information, and build communities. While these platforms provide immense benefits, they are also increasingly exploited by malicious users creating fake profiles. These fake accounts can manipulate social influence, spread misinformation, conduct scams, or even facilitate cyber-attacks. Traditional detection methods, which often rely solely on account metadata or simple heuristics, struggle to identify sophisticated fake profiles that closely mimic genuine user behavior.

In this context, Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) provides a powerful framework to address the problem of fake account detection. By representing users as nodes in a graph and their interactions or similarities as edges, it becomes possible to capture the relational patterns inherent in social networks. This approach allows models to aggregate information from a user’s neighbors, thereby identifying subtle anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity. Unlike conventional models, Graph ML can generalize to unseen accounts and predict their authenticity based on the network structure and node attributes.

This project leverages GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to detect fake accounts effectively. By integrating profile-based features, network relationships, and scalable deep learning techniques, the system can identify suspicious accounts in large-scale social networks. Additionally, visualization tools such as t-SNE embeddings and subgraph plotting are employed to interpret the model’s learned representations, providing both technical validation and actionable insights.

Overall, the proposed system addresses a critical need in modern social media security. By combining Graph ML with a structured data pipeline, it enables real-time, accurate detection of fake accounts, helping social media platforms maintain user trust, ensure platform integrity, and reduce fraudulent activities.



3. Motivation
1. Social Media Vulnerabilities and Impact of Fake Accounts

The rapid growth of social media platforms has brought significant benefits to communication and information sharing, but it has also exposed serious vulnerabilities. Fake accounts are increasingly used to manipulate public opinion, spread misinformation, and exploit users for financial or malicious purposes. These accounts undermine the credibility of social platforms, erode user trust, and can even influence elections or public decisions. Detecting such accounts is therefore critical not only for individual user protection but also for maintaining the integrity and safety of online communities at a societal level.

2. Limitations of Traditional Detection Techniques

Conventional methods for fake profile detection typically rely on rule-based systems, such as flagging accounts with missing profile information, unusual posting patterns, or high follower-to-following ratios. While these methods are useful for catching obvious fraudulent accounts, they fail to detect sophisticated fake profiles that imitate legitimate users. Rule-based or standalone machine learning approaches cannot effectively capture the relational structure and behavioral patterns inherent in social networks. This limitation motivates the adoption of advanced graph-based models capable of learning from both features and network topology.

3. Need for Graph-Based Intelligence and Machine Learning Automation

Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) provides a natural framework for modeling social networks, where users are nodes and their interactions or similarities form edges. Unlike conventional methods, Graph ML can leverage both node features and neighborhood information to make informed predictions. By using Graph Neural Networks such as GraphSAGE, it becomes possible to aggregate information from a user’s connected nodes, identifying subtle patterns that may indicate a fake account. This approach enables automation and scalability, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering and improving detection accuracy.

4. Rise of Large-Scale Social Network Data Requiring Scalable Models

Modern social networks consist of millions of users and billions of interactions, making manual or traditional computational analysis infeasible. The enormous size and dynamic nature of these networks necessitate scalable algorithms that can handle high-dimensional data efficiently. GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, provides a solution by learning node embeddings from local neighborhoods and generalizing to unseen nodes without retraining the entire model. This scalability ensures that the system can remain effective as the network grows and evolves over time.

5. Societal and Privacy Implications

Fake accounts not only pose technical challenges but also have serious societal implications. They can spread harmful content, manipulate public opinion, or harass real users, leading to psychological and social harm. By developing an accurate detection system, social media platforms can mitigate these risks, enhancing user safety and privacy. Additionally, such systems support regulatory compliance and accountability, ensuring that platforms maintain ethical standards in content moderation and user management.

6. Academic and Research Motivation

From a research perspective, fake account detection is a challenging problem that combines network science, machine learning, and data analytics. The rise of Graph ML offers an opportunity to explore new methodologies that were previously impractical for large-scale networks. Developing a system using GraphSAGE contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical applications, providing insights into node representation learning, anomaly detection, and graph-based inference. This research can serve as a foundation for further studies in social network analysis, fraud detection, and online security systems.




4. Motivation Conclusion

The core motivation of this project stems from the pressing need to secure social media platforms against the growing threat of fake profiles. As social media continues to influence communication, information sharing, and even public opinion, the proliferation of fraudulent accounts can have widespread consequences. These accounts not only erode user trust but also create opportunities for cybercrime, scams, and misinformation campaigns. By addressing this problem through advanced machine learning and graph-based techniques, the project aims to strengthen platform integrity and provide safer online environments for users.

From a technical perspective, the limitations of traditional detection methods further reinforce the motivation for this research. Rule-based systems and conventional machine learning models fail to capture the nuanced relationships between users in a social network. Graph Neural Networks, particularly GraphSAGE, allow for the modeling of both node-level features and neighborhood connections, making it possible to detect subtle patterns indicative of fake accounts. This capability is crucial for achieving high detection accuracy, especially in large and complex social networks.

Moreover, the scalability and automation offered by Graph ML approaches make them highly suitable for real-world applications. Social media networks are dynamic, with new users joining constantly, and patterns of fraudulent behavior evolving over time. The inductive learning nature of GraphSAGE ensures that the system can generalize to new, unseen accounts without the need for retraining the entire network. This scalability enhances the practical applicability of the system for platforms with millions of users, providing an efficient and timely solution.

Finally, the societal and academic significance of this project cannot be understated. Beyond improving social media security, the research contributes to the broader field of network analysis, anomaly detection, and machine learning on graphs. It provides insights into how relational and behavioral features can be leveraged for predictive modeling. The successful implementation of this system will not only help mitigate risks associated with fake accounts but also serve as a benchmark for future research in intelligent, graph-based detection systems.



5. Problem Definition

In recent years, the exponential growth of social media platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for communication, networking, and information sharing. However, this growth has also given rise to a significant challenge: the proliferation of fake profiles. These fraudulent accounts are designed to mimic legitimate users, making them difficult to identify with traditional detection methods. They can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, including spreading misinformation, conducting scams, amplifying certain content for manipulation, and harassing or deceiving real users. The complexity of the problem is amplified by the scale of social networks, the evolving nature of fake account behaviors, and the limitations of conventional detection systems that rely solely on isolated profile attributes or simplistic heuristics. Addressing this challenge requires a system capable of leveraging both user-specific features and the relational structure of social networks to accurately and efficiently detect suspicious accounts.

Sub-bullets (Detailed Points):

High Similarity Between Fake and Real Accounts: Sophisticated fake accounts often emulate genuine users’ behavior, making detection based solely on profile metadata or activity patterns unreliable. They may have realistic follower/following ratios, post authentic-looking content, or engage in social interactions that mirror real user behavior.

Large-Scale Social Network Data: Social media platforms contain millions of users and billions of interactions. Detecting fake profiles within such massive datasets requires scalable computational methods capable of efficiently processing and learning from high-dimensional, complex network structures.

Dynamic and Evolving User Behavior: Fake accounts adapt to detection methods and evolve over time. They may change posting patterns, update profile information, or create new connections to bypass traditional rule-based systems, making continuous and adaptive detection necessary.

Limitations of Manual and Rule-Based Detection: Traditional approaches often involve human moderation or hard-coded rules, which are inefficient and error-prone. These methods cannot generalize to unseen or cleverly disguised fake accounts, leading to high false positive or false negative rates.

Need for Real-Time or Near-Real-Time Detection: Platforms require timely identification of fake accounts to prevent the spread of malicious activity. Systems that cannot operate in real time risk allowing fake profiles to influence user behavior, spread misinformation, or perpetrate scams before detection occurs.

Importance of Structural and Relational Analysis: Profile-based features alone are insufficient. Analyzing the relationships between users through graph-based methods provides critical insights into account authenticity, as fake profiles often exhibit anomalous connectivity patterns or unusual neighborhood structures within the social graph.



6. Limitations of This Project

While this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph ML techniques for fake profile detection, several limitations are inherent to the current implementation. One major limitation is the dependency on the available dataset. The system’s performance heavily relies on the quality, diversity, and representativeness of the training data. If the dataset contains biases or is not sufficiently comprehensive, the model may fail to generalize well to new users or different social media platforms.

Another limitation stems from the edge creation strategy used in the graph construction. In this project, edges between nodes are formed based on a cosine similarity threshold of user features. While this method captures some meaningful relationships, it may overlook subtle connections or create spurious links that do not accurately represent real social interactions. Consequently, some fake accounts could remain undetected, and some real accounts may be incorrectly flagged as suspicious.

A third limitation is the interpretability of deep learning models, particularly Graph Neural Networks like GraphSAGE. Although the model can achieve high predictive accuracy, understanding the specific reasons behind a particular prediction can be challenging. This lack of transparency may hinder platform administrators from fully trusting automated decisions without additional validation or explainable AI mechanisms.

Finally, there are practical constraints related to computational resources. Training Graph Neural Networks on large social networks requires significant hardware capabilities, including high memory and GPU acceleration. For extremely large or highly dynamic networks, real-time prediction and continuous model updates may pose challenges. Additionally, this project currently focuses only on structural and profile-based features, without incorporating content analysis from posts, messages, or multimedia, which could provide further insights for more robust detection.



7. Literature Survey Introduction

The detection of fake profiles in social media has been a subject of extensive research due to its critical implications for online security, privacy, and trust. Over the past decade, researchers have explored a variety of approaches, ranging from simple statistical analyses and heuristic-based detection to sophisticated machine learning and graph-based techniques. Traditional methods often focus on individual user features such as the number of followers, posting frequency, and profile completeness. While these approaches can detect obvious fake accounts, they are generally insufficient for handling large-scale networks or sophisticated accounts that closely mimic genuine user behavior. More recent studies have emphasized the importance of relational and structural information in social networks, recognizing that fake accounts often exhibit anomalous connectivity patterns, unusual community memberships, or abnormal interaction behaviors. Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) has emerged as a powerful solution in this context, leveraging both node-level attributes and network structure to perform accurate, scalable, and inductive detection of suspicious accounts. This literature survey introduces key prior research, highlighting existing methods, their advantages, and their limitations, thereby establishing the foundation for the proposed GraphSAGE-based detection system.


8. Literature Review
1. Rule-Based Detection Approaches

Early research in fake account detection relied heavily on rule-based approaches, where predefined thresholds and heuristics were applied to user profile attributes. These methods typically used metrics such as follower-to-following ratios, frequency of posts, account age, and profile completeness to identify suspicious accounts. While effective for detecting clearly fraudulent profiles, these approaches often failed when faced with sophisticated fake accounts that mimic normal user behavior. Additionally, rule-based systems are rigid, requiring constant updates to adapt to evolving tactics employed by malicious actors. Despite their limitations, these approaches laid the groundwork for understanding basic patterns of fraudulent activity.

2. Classical Machine Learning Techniques

With the rise of machine learning, researchers began applying algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Logistic Regression to classify accounts as real or fake. These models leveraged engineered features from user profiles, activity logs, and interaction metrics. Although these methods improved detection accuracy compared to simple heuristics, they still struggled to incorporate relational information present in social networks. Moreover, traditional machine learning models often require extensive feature engineering, which can be labor-intensive and may not generalize well to new or unseen data.

3. Network Analysis and Graph-Based Methods

Recognizing the importance of relationships between users, several studies employed graph-based techniques to detect fake profiles. These methods analyzed connectivity patterns, such as community structures, centrality measures, and clustering coefficients, to identify anomalous nodes in the network. Fake accounts often show unusual connection patterns, including excessive links to other fake accounts or limited connections to genuine users. Graph-based analysis provided deeper insights into social network structure and highlighted the need for models that can leverage both node features and topological information for accurate detection.

4. Deep Learning Approaches

Deep learning techniques, such as feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks, have been applied to social media fraud detection. These models automatically learn complex feature representations, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. However, traditional deep learning models are limited in handling relational data and often fail to capture the graph structure inherent in social networks. This limitation prompted the exploration of Graph Neural Networks, which can incorporate both node features and network topology to enhance detection capabilities.

5. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Fake Profile Detection

Graph Neural Networks, particularly models like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and GraphSAGE, have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques for detecting fake accounts. These models learn node embeddings by aggregating feature information from neighboring nodes, effectively capturing both local and global network patterns. Research demonstrates that GNNs outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning models in identifying subtle anomalies, particularly when fake accounts are designed to mimic legitimate behavior. GNNs are also capable of inductive learning, allowing the system to generalize predictions to unseen nodes without retraining the entire network.

6. Visualization and Explainability in Detection Models

Visualization techniques, including t-SNE and subgraph plotting, have been increasingly used to interpret the embeddings learned by Graph Neural Networks. By projecting high-dimensional embeddings into two or three dimensions, researchers can visually examine clustering patterns of real and fake accounts. Explainable visualization provides valuable insights for both validation and operational deployment, allowing administrators to understand why specific accounts are flagged as suspicious. Combining detection accuracy with interpretability ensures that these models are both effective and trustworthy for real-world applications.



9. Existing System

The existing systems for fake profile detection primarily rely on either rule-based methods, classical machine learning models, or basic network analysis. These systems analyze user profiles, activity metrics, and simple connectivity patterns to flag potentially fraudulent accounts. While they provide a baseline level of detection, their capabilities are limited in handling sophisticated fake accounts that mimic genuine behavior or operate at scale. The existing approaches lack the ability to effectively leverage both user features and relational network structures simultaneously, which reduces their accuracy and adaptability in modern, large-scale social networks.

Subtopics (Detailed Points):

1. Rule-Based Detection Systems

Rule-based systems use predefined thresholds on account attributes such as number of followers, frequency of posts, and account age. Accounts that exceed or fall below these thresholds are flagged as suspicious. While easy to implement, these systems fail against sophisticated fake accounts that can mimic normal behavior and adapt to evade detection. Moreover, they require constant manual updates as fraudulent strategies evolve.

2. Classical Machine Learning Models

Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Decision Trees have been applied to detect fake accounts using engineered features. These models improve detection compared to rule-based approaches but rely heavily on manually designed features. They often struggle to generalize to unseen data and cannot fully leverage the structural information present in social networks.

3. Basic Network Analysis Approaches

Some existing systems incorporate graph metrics like degree centrality, clustering coefficients, or community detection to identify anomalous accounts. While this helps capture relational anomalies, the analysis is often static and shallow, lacking the ability to aggregate feature information from neighbors effectively. As a result, many subtle or well-integrated fake accounts remain undetected.

4. Deep Learning Approaches Without Graph Structure

Deep learning models like feedforward networks or recurrent networks have been used to model account behavior over time. Although these models can learn complex feature representations, they ignore the relationships between users. Since social networks inherently involve interconnections between accounts, these models miss critical contextual information that is essential for accurate detection.

5. Limited Real-Time Detection Capabilities

Most existing systems are designed for batch processing and cannot operate efficiently in real-time. The inability to perform near-instantaneous detection means that fake accounts can continue to interact and influence users before they are flagged. Additionally, these systems often require substantial computational resources to scale to millions of users, further limiting their operational feasibility.




10. Drawbacks of Existing Systems
1. Inability to Detect Sophisticated Fake Accounts

Existing systems often fail to identify fake accounts that closely mimic real user behavior. Sophisticated fraudulent accounts can have realistic follower/following ratios, post content that resembles legitimate activity, and engage in normal-looking social interactions. Rule-based and classical machine learning approaches, which rely primarily on isolated features, are insufficient for detecting such well-disguised accounts, leading to high false-negative rates.

2. Limited Utilization of Network Structure

Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches frequently ignore the relational nature of social networks. These methods treat accounts independently, without considering their connections or neighborhood interactions. As a result, they miss critical anomalies that can only be observed through the structural analysis of the network, such as communities of coordinated fake accounts or unusual link patterns.

3. High Dependency on Feature Engineering

Classical detection systems rely heavily on manually engineered features derived from user profiles or activity metrics. This process is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often fails to capture subtle behavioral patterns. Additionally, manually designed features may not generalize well to different datasets or evolving user behaviors, reducing the adaptability of the system.

4. Poor Scalability to Large Social Networks

Many existing systems are not designed to handle the scale of modern social media platforms. Networks with millions of users and billions of interactions require highly scalable algorithms that can process data efficiently. Rule-based and classical machine learning methods struggle with such volumes, making them impractical for real-world deployment at scale.

5. Lack of Inductive Capability for New Users

Traditional models are typically transductive, meaning they cannot generalize predictions to unseen nodes without retraining. As social networks are dynamic, with new accounts continuously being created, this limitation prevents the system from providing real-time detection for new users, leaving platforms vulnerable to emerging fake profiles.

6. Limited Explainability and Interpretability

Many automated detection systems, particularly deep learning models, act as black boxes. Administrators cannot easily understand why a particular account is flagged as fake, which reduces trust in the system. Lack of transparency can hinder adoption and makes it difficult to validate predictions for compliance or audit purposes.

7. Static Detection Mechanisms

Existing systems often operate on static snapshots of user data or network structure. They do not adapt effectively to changing patterns of account behavior or network dynamics. Fake accounts evolve continuously, adjusting their strategies to bypass detection, which static systems cannot handle efficiently.

8. Insufficient Real-Time and Operational Deployment

Most current systems are designed for offline or batch processing. They cannot provide immediate feedback or near-real-time detection, which is critical for preventing fake accounts from influencing other users. The lack of operational readiness reduces the effectiveness of the detection system and limits its practical utility in maintaining platform integrity.



11. Proposed System

The proposed system addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging Graph Machine Learning, specifically GraphSAGE, to detect fake profiles in social media. It integrates user-level features with the relational structure of the network to identify anomalous accounts accurately and efficiently. By combining scalable graph neural networks, feature normalization, and visualization tools, the system can detect sophisticated fake accounts, generalize to unseen users, and provide interpretable insights for administrators.

Subtopics (Detailed Points):

1. Integration of Node Features and Network Structure

The system captures both individual user attributes and relationships between accounts. Node features include profile statistics such as followers, friends, posts, and account settings, while network edges are based on similarity measures between users. This dual approach enables the model to detect anomalies that arise not just from single-user behavior but also from neighborhood patterns.

2. Use of GraphSAGE for Inductive Learning

GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, allows the system to learn embeddings from local neighborhoods and generalize predictions to new, unseen nodes. This is critical in dynamic social networks where new accounts are continuously created. The inductive capability ensures that the system can operate in real time without retraining on the entire network.

3. Scalable Graph Construction

Edges in the graph are generated using cosine similarity between user feature vectors, forming connections where similarity exceeds a defined threshold. This approach ensures that only relevant relationships are included, reducing computational complexity while maintaining meaningful network information for accurate detection.

4. Feature Normalization with StandardScaler

Before feeding node features into the GraphSAGE model, all attributes are normalized using StandardScaler. This ensures uniformity across features, prevents dominance by any single metric, and allows the neural network to learn effectively from a balanced representation of user data.

5. Stratified Data Splitting for Training and Evaluation

The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution of real and fake accounts. This approach ensures unbiased evaluation and helps the model learn patterns representative of both classes.

6. Use of Cross-Entropy Loss for Classification

The model is trained using cross-entropy loss, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems. In this binary classification scenario, cross-entropy effectively penalizes incorrect predictions and guides the network to optimize for accurate detection of both real and fake accounts.

7. Dropout Regularization for Generalization

Dropout is applied during training to prevent overfitting. By randomly deactivating nodes in the hidden layers, the model learns robust representations that generalize well to unseen data, improving detection performance across diverse social network environments.

8. Visualization of Learned Embeddings

The system includes t-SNE visualization of node embeddings, enabling administrators and researchers to inspect the clustering of real versus fake accounts. This interpretability component provides transparency and builds trust in the automated detection system.

9. Subgraph Visualization for Network Insights

Selected subgraphs of the social network are visualized using NetworkX, highlighting the placement of fake and real accounts. This visual analysis aids in understanding connectivity patterns and provides actionable insights for moderation teams.

10. Confidence-Based Predictions

The system outputs class probabilities for each account, indicating the likelihood of being real or fake. These confidence scores support decision-making, allowing platform administrators to prioritize review or intervention for accounts with high risk.

11. Efficient Inference for New Accounts

Using the inductive property of GraphSAGE and precomputed embeddings, the system can quickly infer the status of new accounts without retraining. This supports near-real-time detection, which is essential for minimizing the impact of fake accounts on the network.

12. Robustness to Noisy Data

The model is designed to handle missing or incomplete profile data. By using graph neighborhood aggregation, it can infer account authenticity even when certain node features are unavailable, improving overall reliability.

13. Model Persistence with PyTorch

Trained models and scalers are saved using PyTorch and Joblib, allowing easy deployment and reuse. This ensures that the system can be integrated into operational platforms with minimal setup while maintaining consistency across predictions.

14. Evaluation Using Standard Metrics

The system is evaluated using classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of detection performance, highlighting the system’s effectiveness in differentiating real and fake accounts.

15. User-Friendly Prediction Interface

A Flask-based web application allows administrators to input user attributes and receive predictions along with confidence scores and visual embeddings. This interface provides accessibility and practical utility, enabling operational deployment for social media platforms



12. Algorithm Used

The core algorithm used in this project is GraphSAGE (Graph Sample and AggregAte), a type of Graph Neural Network designed for inductive learning on large graphs. Unlike traditional graph convolution methods that operate only on fixed graphs, GraphSAGE can generalize to unseen nodes by learning aggregation functions over local neighborhoods. This feature makes it particularly suitable for detecting fake accounts in dynamic social networks, where new users continuously join the platform.

The algorithm works by iteratively aggregating feature information from a node’s neighbors to learn a meaningful embedding. Initially, each node starts with its raw feature vector, which may include profile metrics such as follower count, friend count, posting frequency, and account settings. During each convolution layer, the algorithm samples neighboring nodes and applies an aggregation function, such as mean or max pooling, to combine neighbor features with the node’s own features. This process captures both individual account characteristics and contextual relational information, allowing the network to identify anomalies that may indicate a fake account.

After obtaining node embeddings through multiple aggregation layers, the embeddings are fed into a final classifier layer that predicts the probability of an account being real or fake. Training is performed using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss, comparing predictions against known labels in the dataset. Dropout and feature normalization are applied to improve generalization and stability. The combination of node-level features, neighborhood aggregation, and supervised optimization enables the system to detect subtle fraudulent patterns with high accuracy, while also allowing predictions on previously unseen accounts without retraining the entire model.



13. Advantages of Proposed System

The proposed GraphSAGE-based fake profile detection system provides significant improvements over traditional detection methods. By combining user features with relational network information and employing a scalable graph neural network, the system achieves higher accuracy, adaptability, and practical usability in dynamic social media environments.

Subtopics (Detailed Points):

1. High Accuracy in Detection

By leveraging both node features and network structure, the system accurately identifies fake accounts, even when they closely mimic legitimate user behavior. The aggregation of neighborhood information allows detection of subtle anomalies that traditional methods often miss.

2. Inductive Learning for Unseen Users

GraphSAGE’s inductive capability enables the system to generalize predictions to new accounts without retraining on the entire network. This ensures that the model remains effective in dynamic social networks where new users continuously join.

3. Scalability to Large Networks

The system is designed to handle large-scale social networks efficiently. Neighborhood sampling and aggregation reduce computational complexity, making it feasible to process millions of accounts and their relationships.

4. Robustness to Noisy Data

Even when some profile features are missing or incomplete, the model can infer account authenticity based on relational information from neighboring nodes, ensuring reliable performance under imperfect data conditions.

5. Reduced False Positives and Negatives

By considering both individual attributes and graph structure, the system minimizes misclassification rates. Fake accounts that appear realistic are less likely to evade detection, and real accounts are less likely to be flagged incorrectly.

6. Real-Time or Near-Real-Time Prediction

The inductive design allows quick inference for new accounts, enabling real-time or near-real-time detection. This is critical for preventing fake accounts from spreading misinformation or engaging in harmful activity.

7. Explainable Visualizations

The system provides t-SNE and subgraph visualizations of learned embeddings, helping administrators understand detection results. These visualizations make the system more transparent and trustworthy for operational use.

8. Easy Integration into Platforms

Using PyTorch for the model and Flask for the web interface, the system can be seamlessly integrated into social media platforms. Administrators can input user data and receive predictions through a user-friendly interface.

9. Adaptive to Evolving Fake Account Behavior

By learning embeddings from network neighborhoods rather than relying solely on fixed rules, the system can adapt to evolving behaviors of fake accounts, maintaining effectiveness over time.

10. Minimal Manual Feature Engineering

The model automatically learns complex feature representations from raw input, reducing the need for extensive manual feature engineering and enabling quicker deployment on new datasets.

11. Confidence-Based Decision Making

Predictions are accompanied by confidence scores for both real and fake labels. This allows platform moderators to prioritize account reviews and interventions based on risk levels.

12. Comprehensive Detection Capability

The system combines profile analysis, relational graph information, and machine learning into a single pipeline. This holistic approach ensures a robust detection framework capable of addressing multiple attack vectors employed by fake accounts.



14. Methodology

The methodology of this project is designed to systematically detect fake social media profiles using Graph Machine Learning, combining data preprocessing, graph construction, model training, and prediction deployment. The first step involves data collection and preprocessing, where user profile data such as follower counts, friends counts, posting frequency, and account settings are collected. Missing values are handled by imputing defaults or zeros, and features are scaled using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity. This normalization is critical to prevent features with larger numeric ranges from dominating the learning process and to improve model convergence during training.

The next phase is graph construction, where relationships between users are represented as edges in a graph. Cosine similarity is computed between user feature vectors, and edges are created between users whose similarity exceeds a predefined threshold. This step captures the relational structure inherent in social networks, allowing the model to learn not just from individual features but also from the local and global neighborhood of each node. By representing the social network as a graph, the methodology enables detection of coordinated fake accounts that would be difficult to identify using only isolated profile features.

GraphSAGE-based model training constitutes the core of the methodology. The model aggregates information from neighboring nodes to learn meaningful embeddings that capture both node-level attributes and structural context. Training is performed using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss, optimized via the Adam optimizer. Dropout is applied during training to prevent overfitting, and performance is monitored on a validation set. Finally, the methodology includes deployment and prediction, where the trained model is saved and integrated into a Flask web application. New or unseen user accounts can be evaluated in real time, with the system providing probability scores, classification labels, and visualization of embeddings. This methodology ensures a robust, scalable, and practical solution for detecting fake accounts in modern social networks.



15. Anaconda

Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python and R that simplifies package management, environment creation, and deployment for data science and machine learning projects. In this project, Anaconda provides a controlled and reproducible environment for managing all dependencies required for Graph Machine Learning, including PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and other supporting libraries. By creating isolated virtual environments within Anaconda, the project ensures that specific library versions are maintained, preventing compatibility issues and version conflicts that can occur when multiple projects share the same system Python installation. This isolation is crucial for ensuring that the GraphSAGE model and the Flask-based prediction application function reliably across different machines and deployment platforms.

Another key advantage of Anaconda is its package management capabilities. Using the Conda package manager, required libraries can be installed, updated, or removed efficiently without affecting other projects. Anaconda also provides precompiled binaries for complex libraries like PyTorch Geometric, which can otherwise be challenging to install due to system-specific compilation requirements. Furthermore, Anaconda integrates seamlessly with Jupyter Notebooks and IDEs such as VS Code and PyCharm, enabling interactive development, debugging, and experimentation. This facilitates rapid prototyping, model tuning, and visualization of results, making Anaconda an essential tool for maintaining a smooth and productive workflow throughout the project lifecycle.



16. Libraries Used

The project utilizes several Python libraries for data preprocessing, graph construction, machine learning, and deployment. Each library plays a crucial role in the development and effectiveness of the system.

1. Pandas

17. Source Code Explanation

The source code of this project is divided into two main components: training the GraphSAGE model and deploying the prediction application using Flask. Each step in the code has a specific role in ensuring accurate fake profile detection and seamless operational use.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The first step in the training code involves reading the CSV dataset containing user profiles using Pandas. Important features such as followers_count, friends_count, statuses_count, and account attributes like verified and protected are extracted. Missing values are filled with zeros to ensure consistency across nodes. Then, StandardScaler from scikit-learn is applied to normalize all features, making them comparable in magnitude. Normalization prevents features with larger numerical values from dominating the training process, which is critical for stable learning in neural networks.

Next, cosine similarity is computed between all pairs of user profiles to determine relational edges. A threshold (e.g., 0.85) is applied to filter connections, creating edges only between highly similar accounts. This approach captures communities and coordinated fake account networks while maintaining computational efficiency. The filtered edges are then converted into the edge_index tensor required by PyTorch Geometric, representing the graph structure of the social network.

2. Graph Construction and Masking

The dataset is transformed into a PyTorch Geometric Data object containing node features (x), edge indices (edge_index), and labels (y). Boolean masks for training, validation, and testing are created using stratified splits to maintain class balance. These masks ensure that the model learns from a representative sample of real and fake accounts while evaluating performance on unseen nodes. This structured approach allows the GraphSAGE model to leverage both node features and network relationships during training.

3. GraphSAGE Model Implementation

The GraphSAGE model is implemented with two layers of SAGEConv, followed by ReLU activations and dropout. The first layer aggregates neighbor information into hidden embeddings, while the second layer outputs node-level logits for classification. Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating nodes during training, forcing the model to learn robust representations. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss, which penalizes incorrect predictions based on ground truth labels. This combination allows the system to distinguish subtle differences between real and fake accounts efficiently.

4. Training Loop and Evaluation

The model is trained iteratively for a fixed number of epochs. In each epoch, the optimizer (Adam) updates the model weights to minimize cross-entropy loss. After every few epochs, validation accuracy is computed using the validation mask to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting. Finally, the trained model is evaluated on the test set using standard classification metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. This evaluation ensures that the model can generalize to unseen accounts and provides quantitative evidence of its effectiveness.

5. Visualization of Results

Two types of visualizations are included to enhance interpretability. First, NetworkX is used to visualize selected subgraphs, highlighting real versus fake nodes with different colors. Second, t-SNE from scikit-learn reduces the high-dimensional node embeddings into a 2D plane for plotting. These visualizations allow administrators and researchers to see clustering patterns of fake accounts, making the system more transparent and explainable.

6. Model and Scaler Persistence

The trained model is saved using torch.save, and the StandardScaler is serialized using Joblib. This allows the Flask application to reuse the trained model and normalization parameters for real-time predictions without retraining. Persisting these objects ensures consistent predictions and simplifies deployment, making the system operationally ready for production environments.

7. Flask Prediction Application

In the Flask app, new user data is collected via an HTML form and preprocessed using the same StandardScaler used during training. A new node is added to the graph, and edges are constructed based on cosine similarity to existing users. The GraphSAGE model, loaded from the saved state, predicts the account label as real or fake. Confidence scores are also generated to indicate prediction certainty. The results are displayed dynamically in the web interface, alongside visualizations like confidence bars and t-SNE embeddings, providing an intuitive interface for administrators.

19. Result Analysis

The results of the GraphSAGE-based fake profile detection system were evaluated using multiple metrics, visualizations, and real-world testing. The analysis provides insights into model accuracy, embedding separability, and prediction reliability, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1. Classification Accuracy

The model achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset, effectively distinguishing between real and fake accounts. Accuracy was measured as the ratio of correctly predicted accounts to the total number of accounts, and the system consistently performed well across multiple validation splits. High accuracy indicates that the model successfully leverages both node features and graph structure to capture the subtle differences between genuine and fraudulent profiles.

Furthermore, the model maintained balanced performance across both classes, preventing bias towards real accounts. This balance is critical because fake accounts often attempt to mimic legitimate users, making detection challenging. By combining structural and feature-based learning, the system ensures robust generalization, which is particularly important in large, dynamic social networks where new accounts continuously appear.

2. Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Precision and recall metrics were calculated to evaluate the model’s ability to correctly identify fake accounts without misclassifying real users. High precision demonstrates that the majority of accounts flagged as fake were indeed fraudulent, minimizing false positives. High recall ensures that most fraudulent accounts were successfully detected, minimizing false negatives.

The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, confirmed that the system maintains a strong trade-off between avoiding false alarms and capturing fraudulent accounts. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model’s effectiveness beyond simple accuracy, reflecting its practical utility in real-world social media moderation scenarios.

3. t-SNE Embedding Visualization

The 2D t-SNE projections of node embeddings revealed clear separability between real and fake accounts. Real accounts clustered together, while fake accounts formed distinct groups or outliers, demonstrating that the GraphSAGE model effectively learned discriminative representations from both user features and network structure.

This visualization allows administrators to interpret model decisions and identify clusters of suspicious accounts. By analyzing embedding spaces, moderators can detect coordinated fake account networks, enhancing the overall security and integrity of the platform.

4. Subgraph Analysis

Selected subgraphs visualized using NetworkX highlighted the connectivity patterns of real versus fake accounts. Fake accounts tended to form tightly connected communities or anomalous structures that stood out from normal user interactions. Real accounts generally exhibited more dispersed and organic connections.

Subgraph analysis is particularly useful for understanding the propagation of fraudulent behavior within the network. It provides actionable insights for platform moderators, such as identifying potential clusters of coordinated attacks or spam campaigns.

5. Confidence Scores Evaluation

Predictions for each account were accompanied by confidence scores, indicating the probability of being real or fake. The system consistently provided high-confidence predictions for most accounts, enhancing trust in its automated decisions. Confidence scores also help prioritize account review by highlighting ambiguous or borderline cases for manual inspection.

By combining probabilistic outputs with network-based features, the system reduces the risk of erroneous decisions and provides a transparent framework for moderation teams to act upon.

6. Real-Time Prediction Performance

The Flask-based deployment allowed testing of real-time predictions for new user accounts. The system was able to classify accounts and update embeddings rapidly, demonstrating its capability for near-real-time monitoring in production environments. This ensures that potentially harmful accounts can be flagged before causing significant damage.

Efficient real-time predictions are crucial for large platforms with millions of users. The GraphSAGE architecture, combined with edge sampling and efficient preprocessing, supports scalable, timely detection of fake profiles.	



20. Conclusion

The GraphSAGE-based fake profile detection system demonstrates a powerful approach to identifying fraudulent accounts in social media networks by combining user features with relational information. Traditional detection methods often rely solely on isolated account attributes, which makes them vulnerable to sophisticated fake accounts that mimic legitimate behavior. By leveraging graph neural networks, this system captures both the intrinsic characteristics of users and the patterns of their connections, significantly improving detection accuracy and reliability.

The project successfully implemented a full pipeline from data preprocessing, graph construction, model training, to real-time deployment using a Flask application. The trained GraphSAGE model achieved high classification accuracy, robust precision and recall, and provided interpretable visualizations through t-SNE embeddings and subgraph analyses. These results confirm that incorporating network structure is crucial for detecting coordinated fraudulent behavior that would otherwise remain hidden in traditional feature-based approaches.

Another significant outcome of the project is the ability to perform inductive learning for unseen users.
